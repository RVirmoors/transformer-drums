# Transformer Drums

Playing Drums with Transformers - a series of experiments

## 1. Time series

- if running locally, follow the [startup instructions](startup.md). Else, you can load the .py scripts into Colab or something else.
- make sure the virtual environment is active.

### 1.1. Encoder -> Output

Basic experiment: can a Transformer "predict" a value if its Encoder sees the whole sequence?

- run `python time-series.py`
